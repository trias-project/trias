# trias

Trias is an R package originally conceived to provide functionalities
for the [Tracking Invasive Alien Species
(TrIAS)](https://trias-project.be) project. However, it has been further
developed to support other similar projects, such as the [LIFE
RIPARIAS](https://www.riparias.be) and
[B-Cubed](https://docs.b-cubed.eu/) projects.
